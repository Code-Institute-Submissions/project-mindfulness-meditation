            <p>Before we delve into the techniques, let's first have a look at a couple of concepts:</p>

                <h3>Mindfulness vs Meditation</h3>
                <p>So, how do mindfulness and meditation differ? Meditation is generally a more formal practice, usually performed in a seated position with the aim of focusing your mind on a particular thing, such as your breath, a positive scene and so on. Mindfulness however is more about simply being aware of yourself and your surroundings and being present in the current moment, without thinking about past or future cares or worries. You can perform mindfulness at any time, wherever you are or who you are with. Mindfulness exercises are sometimes performed during formal meditation sessions but don’t always need to be. </p>

                <h3>Guided vs Unguided Meditation</h3>
                <p>Guided meditation is where you have a teacher or other form of guidance, such as via an app, to steer
                    your meditation session. This can be helpful for those new to meditation as it gives an idea of what
                    to expect.<br><br>
                    Unguided meditation (silent meditation) is done alone and can simply involve performing tasks such
                    as concentrating on your breath or thoughts, etc. to help calm yourself and improve focus.<br><br>
                    Any of the techniques below, apart from the Movement meditation, can be performed as either guided or unguided.

            <h3>Body Scan meditation <i class="fas fa-wifi"></i></h3>
            <p>With this meditation technique, you go through the different areas of your body, concentrating on relaxing each in turn. You can perform this meditation standing, sitting or lying down, whichever suits you best. Closing your eyes while doing this will aid relaxation. Start by taking a few slow, deep breaths. Pay attention to the different parts of your body, starting with any areas that feel particularly tense and if none are, concentrate on your feet and work your way up. As you are scanning each part of the body, visualise releasing the tension in that area through slow, deep breaths before moving onto the next. Once you have gone over all areas of the body, you should be feeling more relaxed. Attempt to do this for 5 – 10 minutes a day initially, building up from there as you become more used to it.</p>

            <h3>Mindfulness meditation <i class="fas fa-brain"></i></h3>
            <p>not judge them. Rather, merely observe and pay attention to any patterns you notice. To perform this meditation, start by getting yourself into a comfortable seated or lying position, you may close your eyes if you wish.  Take a few deep breaths and simply let thoughts enter your mind, observing them as they do so without any judgment. The aim of this exercise is to enhance concentration and awareness. Try to do this for 5 – 10 minutes.</p>

        <div class="technique-block">
            <h3>Movement meditation <i class="fas fa-walking"></i></h3>
            <p>This meditation technique relies on the sensation of being in movement and using that to guide you on the meditative journey. To get started, simply pick an activity which you enjoy doing such as going for a walk, doing some yoga, going for a bike ride, etc. While performing the action of your choice, simply focus on the sensation of the movement and your environment.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="technique-block">
            <h3>Visualization meditation <i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i></h3>
            <p>The goal of this meditation technique is to visualise positive scenes, images or scenarios and use that to develop a sense of calm and relaxation in yourself. To get started, enter into a comfortable seated or lying position and close your eyes. Now imagine something that you find calming, such as a walk on the beach, relaxing with a hot chocolate, etc. While doing so, try to imagine this as clearly as possible. Consider details such as sights, sounds, smells, tastes and textures. This form of meditation can be used to help create better focus and motivation.</p>

        <div class="technique-block">
            <h3>Breath awareness meditation <i class="fas fa-wind"></i></h3>
            <p>This meditation centres around the mindful activity of concentrating only on your breath and nothing else. Start by getting yourself into a comfortable seated or lying position and close your eyes if you wish. Take a few deep breaths; these are slow and deep breaths from your stomach.  Pay attention to the in and out breath and if your mind starts to wander, bring it back to your breathing. Do this for 5 – 10 minutes, you should feel more relaxed afterwards. This meditation can help to reduce anxiety and improve mental focus.</p>

            <h3>Qigong meditation <i class="fas fa-seedling"></i></h3>
            <p>To perform this meditation, you start by getting into a comfortable seated position with your back straight. Take a few breaths and try to release any tension from your body. Now, take some deep breaths that fill your belly area and visualise something called your “Qi” or life energy centre being a few centimetres below your belly button. Continue taking long, slow breaths and imagine with each breath that you are focusing your Qi and that it is flowing through your body, leaving you feeling invigorated. Aim to do this for 5 - 10 minutes.</p>
