# Meditation Newbie

My website is designed to be a gentle introduction to mindfulness and meditation for those who may be unfamiliar with the concepts. It will include some easy to understand techniques to get you started and also explain some of the benefits to performing mindfulness and meditation exercises. I will also go briefly into the difference between guided and unguided meditation and how mindfulness and meditation differ, despite often being mentioned together as if they were perhaps one in the same.

## UX

As noted in my introduction, I'm aiming my website at users who are perhaps new to the concepts of mindfulness and meditation and who are looking for advice on what they are, techniques to try and some of the known benefits to performing mindfulness and meditation exercises. I will also provide some links to further reading and suggested apps. The colour scheme used is dark brown for the header, footer and input button backgrounds with light coloured text. The rest of the website uses a pale green grey background, with an off-white for the text box backgrounds and also very dark green coloured text. These colours convey a natural theme and tie up with the homepage background image, the video on the techniques page and the flower images at the bottom of the techniques, benefits, contact us and confirmation pages. See below the wireframes for the home, techniques, benefits and contact us pages:

![Wireframe of contact us page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/domsq/project-mindfulness-meditation/master/screenshots/contact-us-wireframe.JPG)

Compared with the wireframes above, I went with a slight variation on the homepage, which meant I had to move the mindfulness vs. meditation and guided vs. unguided information to the techniques page. I also added the flower images to the bottom of the techniques, benefits and contact us pages as well as added the confirmation page for form input. I also added the video to the techniques page.

The user will land on the homepage when accessing the website. They then either click on the "Enter" button or click on the "Techniques" link in the navigation bar to be taken to the Techniques page.

![Image of benefits page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/domsq/project-mindfulness-meditation/master/screenshots/benefits-page.JPG)<br>
The website has been tested using the following browsers:<br>
- Google Chrome<br>
- Microsoft Edge<br>
- Mozilla Firefox<br><br>
Within Chrome and Edge, the following breakpoints were checked using responsive mode:<br>
- Mobile S - 320px<br>
- Mobile M - 375px<br>
- Mobile L - 425px<br>
- Tablet - 768px<br>
- Laptop - 1024px<br>
- Laptop L - 1440px<br><br>
As well as the following emulated devices:<br>
- iPhone 5/SE<br>
- iPhone 6/7/8<br>
- iPhone 6/7/8 Plus<br>
- iPhone X<br>
- iPad<br>
- iPad Pro<br><br>
In Firefox, the following emulated device sizes were checked:<br>
- Galaxy S9/S9+ Android 7.0<br>
- iPad<br>
- iPhone 6/7/8 iOS 11<br>
- iPhone 6/7/8 Plus iOS 11<br>
- iPhone X/XS iOS 12<br>
- Kindle Fire HDX Linux

The website was also checked at full width on a 1080p and 4K screen and tested on Oppo Find X2 Lite and Samsung Galaxy S20 FE 5G handsets. Media queries were added where necessary to maintain site viewability.<br>
The website has been optimised for 1080p and smaller screens but works fine on a 4K monitor. If viewing on a screen other than 1080p, the website scales accordingly. I also had a friend who is vision impaired have a look over the website and she was able to browse the site without issue and read all the content.

### Bugs 

While developing my website, I encountered the following bugs which were either fixed through additional media queries or CSS styling properties:<br>
- Homepage image didn't display as expected on screens above 2100px wide or on the emulated iPad Pro size in portrait orientation.<br>
- Footer didn't display correctly when viewed in the Firefox browser.<br>
- The benefits page had a gap below the footer initially.<br>
- The header element with navigation links didn't display correctly when viewed in the Firefox browser.<br><br>
As noted, these bugs have since been corrected.<br>
### Validator Testing

- HTML
    - No errors returned when tested using the official W3C validator:

- CSS
    - No errors but 3 warnings when tested using the official Jigsaw validator:
    ![Image of Jigsaw validation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/domsq/project-mindfulness-meditation/master/screenshots/jigsaw-check-result.JPG)<br>
    ![Image of Jigsaw warnings](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/domsq/project-mindfulness-meditation/master/screenshots/jigsaw-warnings.JPG)
    The first warning is simply stating it couldn't check an import link due to the vaidation method being direct input. The remaining 2x warnings are due to a style property I needed to add to make the footer display correctly in the Firefox browser.
