# Meditation Newbie

My website is designed to be a gentle introduction to mindfulness and meditation for those who may be unfamiliar with the concepts. It will include some easy to understand techniques to get you started and also explain some of the benefits to performing mindfulness and meditation exercises. I will also go briefly into the difference between guided and unguided meditation and how mindfulness and meditation differ, despite often being mentioned together as if they were perhaps one in the same.

## UX

As noted in my introduction, I'm aiming my website at users who are perhaps new to the concepts of mindfulness and meditation and who are looking for advice on what they are, techniques to try and some of the known benefits to performing mindfulness and meditation exercises. I will also provide some links to further reading and suggested apps. The colour scheme used is dark brown for the header, footer and input button backgrounds with light coloured text. The rest of the website uses a pale green grey background, with an off-white for the text box backgrounds and also very dark green coloured text. These colours convey a natural theme and tie up with the homepage background image, the video on the techniques page and the flower images at the bottom of the techniques, benefits, contact us and confirmation pages. See below the wireframes for the home, techniques, benefits and contact us pages:

![Wireframe of contact us page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/domsq/project-mindfulness-meditation/master/screenshots/contact-us-wireframe.JPG)

Compared with the wireframes above, I went with a slight variation on the homepage, which meant I had to move the mindfulness vs. meditation and guided vs. unguided information to the techniques page. I also added the flower images to the bottom of the techniques, benefits and contact us pages as well as added the confirmation page for form input. I also added the video to the techniques page.

## Features

The website features a navigation bar, that is present on all pages. This allows users to easily navigate to any part of the site they wish to visit:
