# Meditation Newbie

My website is designed to be a gentle introduction to mindfulness and meditation for those who may be unfamiliar with the concepts. It will include some easy to understand techniques to get you started and also explain some of the benefits to performing mindfulness and meditation exercises. I will also go briefly into the difference between guided and unguided meditation and how mindfulness and meditation differ, despite often being mentioned together as if they were perhaps one in the same. 

## UX

As noted in my introduction, I'm aiming my website at users who are perhaps new to the concepts of mindfulness and meditation and who are looking for advice on what they are, techniques to try and some of the known benefits to performing mindfulness and meditation exercises. I will also provide some links to further reading and suggested apps. User stories as follows:
